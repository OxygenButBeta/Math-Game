# Brain Math

This game was originally planned to be available on the Google Play Store, but my Play Store account was closed during development, and the game was removed.

## About the Game

This project was created when I was still new to game development. While the game is simple, it has its quirks. The objective is to solve math problems to progress to the next level. Some puzzles can be quite tricky. The game serves as a way to challenge your math skills and logic, with increasing difficulty as you advance through the levels.
